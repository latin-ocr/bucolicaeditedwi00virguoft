period, with not long between them. We shall not be far wrong
in referring thern both to the year 41, perhaps to the first half
of it.

The fourth in the matter of date is certain3 it was written
in ΒΕ. 40, the year of Polio’s consulship.

The eighth Eclogue is, like the fourth, in honour of Polio, and
refers expressly (lines 6, 7) to his successful expedition against
the Illyrian tribe called the Parthini ; this fixes the date to be
approximately the year 39 in which Polio won his victory.

The sixth Eclogue is addressed to Varus, no doubt the same
friend who had been one of the successful pleaders to the
Emperor for the restoration of Vergil's property; he has been
spoken of above as Alfenus Varus, though even his name is not
certain. There is no mention of any events to give the poem a
date ; and we are obliged to have recourse to conjecture. Vergil
has in this poem dropped for the occasion the task of imitating
Theocritus. It is an Idyll in form3 but the interest of it lies in
the references to mythology and philosophy in the song of
Silenus. The poem is altogether a new departure; andin the
lines that follow 31 there is a very strong reflection of the style
of Lucretius. Varus is supposed to have been one of the
commissioners (as we noted above) along with Polio, to distribute
the lands to the soldiers after Philippi ; and to have succeeded
Polio in the administration of Lornbardy when Polio was
removed. It is not improbable that it was about this time—
i.e., about 41 or early in 40—that this Eclogue was written.

There is nothing to help us to date the seventh Eclogue
except the style. This is purely Theocritean ; and may be
placed with probability among the earlier work, perhaps between
the first and the second group. It will probably be later than
EcL 5, as we may guess that if it had been then written, it would
have been mentioned, along with the two earliest, in lines 86—87
of the fifth.

The tenth is expressly stated to be the last, in the opening
to apply to Augustus; that he applied and was successful τ and that he

then wrote (a few months later) the ‘ grateful ’ Eclogue 1. It would be
natural to place this first in the collection.
