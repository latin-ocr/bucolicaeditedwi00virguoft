JNTROD UCTJON. 9

Vergil was steeped‘from boyhood in Greek3 and that he
should begin his poetic career by imitation of Greek models was
both natural and indeed inevitable. It was also particularly
natural that he should be attracted first to Theocritus. The
Idylls were short poems, fit for a first flight. The imitation
allowed considerable range of subject ; and this range he
extended. Moreover Theocritus at his best is extremely beauti-
ful, with just the sort of dreamy and luscious beauty most attrac-
tive to youth ; and to a youth of Vergil's delicate ear and exquisite
taste irresistibly tempting to imitate. Lastly it was an untried
field. How he carried out this original literary venture we shall
see below : but it is first necessary to discuss the order in which
the Eclogues were written.

2. Dales of tlze Ec‘logues.

There is a good deal of uncertainty about the dates of several
of these poems 3 but without attempting to fix the dates exactly
of all, we can group thern pretty confidently in an approximate
chronological order.

Eclogues 2, 3, and 5 clearly belong together3 they are all
early work, and close Theocritean imitations ; and the second and
third are mentioned in the fifth, lines 86-87, in a way which
suggests that these two were the only ones then written when
the fifth was being composed. The lanient for Daphnis in this
last poem, and particularly the passage which speaks of the
deification of the shepherd, lines 56—64, and the coupling of
Daphnis with the altars of Apollo, line 66, has with great
probability been supposed to refer to Julius Caesar3 and it has
been conjectured moreover that it was written for the sacred
birthday of Julius Caesar held on the 4th July, B.C. 42, when the
name of the month Quintilis was changed first to Julius. This
falls in with internal probability ; and we may provisionally fix
42 as the date by which this group was finished.

The second group consists of Ecl. 1 and 9, which concern the
question of the farm at Andes. After the battle of Philippi in
BC. 42, in which the Emperor Augustus, then called Octavianus,
had defeated the party of Brutus and Cassius, the murdercrs of
