NOTES. 79

Corsican honey was bad, and yews were bad for bees (Georg. 11. 2 57) ε
so the poet naturally calls yew trees ‘ Corsican '‚ to suggest the badness
of the honey which will result.

33. Pierides, above, vul. 64.

3³· Varius, a poet coupled with Vergil by Horace who speaks of
them as '‘ Earth‘s purest spirits, best beloved by me’ (Sat. 1. v. 40) ι and
says of Varius that ‘ he wrote epics with more spirit than any one' (ib.
Ι. x. 44). He edited the Aeneia' (with Tucca) by Augustus’ orders after
Ver il's death.

Ξῖ Helvius Cinna, a poet and friend of Catullus, who was murdered
B.C. 44 by the angry mob in mistake for Cinna, the friend of the
conspirators. He occurs in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar as ‘Cinna a

oet'.
p 36. ‘but to eackle, a very goose, among melodious swans': a
satirical reference to a certain poet Anser, a friend of Antony the
triumvir, mentioned by Ovid (Tr. Π. 435) as one of a long list of love-
poetS, and by Propertius (3, 32, 84) who says ‘the swan is not silenced
by the unlearned song of the goose'.

37. id ago, ‘that is what Ι am trying'.

38. si valeam, ‘ if perchance Ι might ’, ‘in hopes I might’.

40. purpureum, ‘ bright' : used by poets of swans, light, eyes, love,
and even snow. .

43. feriant sine, ‘let them strike’: construction like velim venias,
hortamur petamus, oro permittas, ἃς. where the subj. is jussive and
made to depend on the principal verb. Even in prose it is not
uncommon (though the const. with ut is commoner): but in poetry it is
almost universal.

44. quid, quae, i.e. ‘ what of those which...?’

45. numeros memini, sz' verba tenerem, ‘1 remember the tune, if
only I knew the words': an elliptieal conditional sentence, of a kind
common in all languages: the full expression would be, ‘1 remember
the tune, and l should know τί* all, or and I could have sung it, if Ι only
had not sorgotten the words'.

tenerem, ‘if Ι now knew' [not ‘if Ι could get the words' as C.]:
i.e. it is a present conditional, not a future one.

47. Dionaei. Dione in Homer (ll. v. 370) is the mother of
Aphrodite or Venus, who is called Dionaea, Aen. 111. 19: Venus being
the mother of Aeneas and so the ancestress of the Iulii, Caesar (Iulius) is
called Dz'onaeus. [The name is originally a sem. form of Di· or Zeus,
and etymologically is the same as luna]

astrum. During the festival of Venus, celebrated by Octavius after
the murder of Iulius Caesar, there appeared a brilliant comet, visible
for seven days. This was hailed by Octavius and the people as ‘the
star of Iulius’, a sign he was now a god: and a statue was put up (in
Venus' temple) to the new god, with a golden star on its head. This
constantly appears on gems and coins of the time, and is referred to by
the poets: Iulium sidus, Hor. Ocl. 1. xii. 46 : Ov. splet. XV. 847 tells the
whole tale in a fancisul way.

48—49. gauderent and duceret are final subj. after quo: ‘a star to
make the crops glad with grain ’ &c.
