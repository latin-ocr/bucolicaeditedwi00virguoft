NOTES. 77

ECLOGUE IX.

The ninth Eclogue concerns the same subject as the first, the
confiscation of Vergil’s farm near Mantua for the soldiers of Antony
and Octavianus. The circumstances are fully explained in the Intro·
duction (p. 9 .

The Eclogue is Theocritean, and dramatie in character. Moeris a
farm servant of Menalcas (who is here in the background, but represents
the poet himself as before) is carrying kids to town for the new owner,
when he is stopped by a neighbour. To him he pours out his
complaints. Lycidas the neighbour says he understood Menalcas had
saved the farm by his songs. ‘It was so said' replies Moeris, ‘but
what are songs among soldiers?’ They then fall to talking about
Menalcas, and quote fragments of his songs. Moeris gives a song to
Varus, to Galatea, to Daphnis, then apologises for his lost voice. At
last they resolve to wait for Menalcas himself.

[1—16. Lyc. Whither away Moeris? Alloer. It has come to this,
a stranger turns us out of our land. I arn taking these kids to him.
Lyc. I had heard the whole estate—from hills to river—had been
saved by Menalcas’ poetry. Affoer. It was so said: but poetry is not
of much power among rude soldiers: nay, had not omens warned me
to desist from the strife, neither master nor man would have escaped.]

1. pedes: the verb ‘carry you’ is easily understood, especially with
ducit following.

2. pervenimus...ut‚ lit. ⁴ we have come [to such a point] that': i.e.
‘it has come to this, that we see &c.’ ; ⁶ we have lived to see‘. vivi
heightens the wrong: it is bad enough for land to pass to a stranger by
death.

6. quod nec vertat bene, ‘plague upon him ’, lit. ‘ may it not prosperl'

nec, generally explained as an archaism : it was anciently used as a
simple negativeznon: nec-opinus, nec obediens (Cic.)‚ nec recte dicere
[=n211led2‘cere]‚ Plaut. It also occurs in the XII Tables with the verb
to lle. '

mittimus, ‘ we are taking’ : he as the farm slave is driving the goats
to the town (Mantua) where the soldier (owner or claimant) lives.

7—10. This precise and interesting description looks as if it was the
real picture of Vergil’s farm: if so, it must have been some little way
from Mantua northward. But the exact position of Andes is not
known.

10. Menalcas as before is obviously meant for the poet. Doubtless
what recommended the youthful poet to Varus, Gallus, and Polio was
in the first instance his talent already recognized.

13. Chaoniae, ‘of Dodona’, ancient Greek sanctuary in Chaonia
part of Epirus.

14. incidere, ‘to cut short', obviously by retiring from the combat.
The soldier has the farm allotted to him: the owner at first resists,
expecting to prevail by aid of his friends, but the brute force of the
soldier is too strong sor him, and he gives way before personal danger.
