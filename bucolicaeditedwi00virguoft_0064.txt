60 VERGJL. E CL. J V.

30. roscida mella, ‘the honeydew': referring to the superstition
that the skies dropped sweet dew on the leaves, whence the bees
plucked honey with no trouble.

The superstition is doubtless due to the common phenomenon of
trees being covered in summer with a gummy sweet substance (called
in English also ⁴h01ieydew')‚ which is really a secretion of aphides.

The acc. is a sort of quasi-cognate: something like agere Cyclopa,
saltare puellam, vox hominem sonat, Aen. Ι. 328.

31. fraudis, in a general sense ‘mischief’‚ ¹ill'.

3²- Thetis, the sea goddess, daughter of Nereus, used by common
poetic convention for ‘the sea‘ (like Bacchus, Ceres, Mars, ἃς. for
wine, corn, war, δια).

32—3. The ‘traces of ill’ are apparently needsul to make the
interest and the adventure of lise: voyages, cities‚ agriculture, and
fighting3 the Argonauts‚ the ancient wars, the Trojan expedition are all
to come over again.

34. The Arge, the ship which bore the Greek heroes under Jason
across the Archipelago to setch the golden fleece from Colchis: Tz'plzys
was the Boeotian steersnian of the ship.

qnae vehat, final subj.

37. ‘when thy age is strengthened to manhood’ is the sense:
the phrase is slightly artificialised in V.'s later manner.

40. rastros, variant form for rastra.

42. memmi, bold expressive word sor salse colours of dyed wool:
‘to inock the diverse hues’.

44. mutabit vellera luto: the simplest construction is probably
right, ‘change his fleece willc yellow...'‚ i.e. assume the yellow dye.
'l‘he conception of ranis becoining naturally purple, scarlet, or yellow,
is rather grotesque.

45. sanasyx, ‘scarlet'‚ a dye derived from a mineral according to
Pliny.

46. talia saccla...currz'le: some take saecla voc. ‘Run on great
ages’ sang the Fates to their spindles : but talia is awkward, and so is
the voc. with fusis: if the Fates spoke to their spindles why should
saecla be voc.? Better (with Forb. Voss. L. K.) translate ‘Run on
through such great· ages’ 3 like currere aequor, currere stadium.

The phrase is imitated from Catullus, Currite ducentes subtemina,
currite fusi.

[48—end. Enter on thy honours, thou child os Iuppiter! All the
world awaits thee with joy. O may I be blest with lise to tell os thy
deeds—then Orpheus, Linus, nor Pan should out-sing me. child,
sniile on thy mother, and let her smile on thee—else how canst thou

be raised to heaven ?]
49. lovis imwcmcnlum, ‘offshoot of Iuppiter’: the rare word and

bold and unusual rhythrn emphasizing the stateliness and dignity of

the *igia‘cmwexo pondere, ‘the weight of its dome’: the world tollers

nt the approach of the ‘mighty scion of the gods', and the new great
tnnc.
