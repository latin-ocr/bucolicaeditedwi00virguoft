line. The whole must have been published some time before
the first book of Horace’s Satires, where Vergil is spoken of as
the recognised representative of rustic poetry‚ Sat. i. 10, 45.
This book of Satires is dated 35 B.C., and we may therefore

accept the ordinary date given for the appearance of the
Eclogues as about 37.

The following table will then give the dates of the Eclogues
with a fair approximation to the truth 3—

a poet sending a collection of poems to his patron, that we
can hardly resist the conclusion that the Eclogue in which they
occur was meant to be, or actually was, the last one of the book.

3. T lle execution of llze Paean.

We are now in a position to consider the execution of the
Eclogues regarded as a work of art ; for the arrangement of the
pieces in some sort of chronological order is a great help
towards understanding the growth of the poet’s mind and the
development of his art.

The first four, that is, the second, third, fifth, and sevcnth,
belong to the class of purely Theocritean imitations. They are
not in any sense translations, though plenty of phrases, and even
whole lines, are given almost verbatim; the young poet takes
