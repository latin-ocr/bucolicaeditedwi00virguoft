INTRODUCTION.

FOR the sake of clearness it has been thought better to
divide what little there is to say. by way of introduction into the
following heads :—

1. The form of the poem.
2. Dates of the Eclogues.
3. The execution of the poem.
4. Outline of Vergil’s life.

At the end is an appendix giving the main parallels from
Theocritus, and a full index to the notes, (1) General and
Grammatical, (2) of Style‚ (3) of Proper names, to enable the
book to be used for purposes of ready reference.
