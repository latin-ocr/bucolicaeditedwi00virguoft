Olympia in Elis), fied from his pursuit. She changed into a stream and
flowed under the sea, emerging again as a spring in Ortygia, a little
island in the harbour of Syracuse. She naturally belongs to the powers
invoked by Sicilian poetry.

2. For Gallus and Lycoris seeIntroduction to the Eclogue‚ above.

4. sic tibi...z'ncipe. See 1Χ. 30.

Sicanos. Vergil identifies Sicani or Siculi and uses both names
indifferently sor *Sicilian'. According to Thuc. VI. 2, they were two
different races of immigrants who carne into the island at different times,
the Sicani first, from Spain, the Siculi afterwards from Italy.

5. Doris is the wife of Nereus, the seagod, and here stands
for the seawater personified: cf. the similar use of Thetis, Bacchus,
Ceres.

6. sollicitos, ‘troublous’.

7. simae, Greek word σιμός, ‘ssat-nosed’.

8. respondent, ‘ reecho’.

[9—30. Where were ye, Nymphs, when Gallus lay dying? Not by
Parnasus, nor Pindus, nor Aganippe. Trees bewailed him, and mountains:
the sheep, the herdsmen ε Apollo, Silvanus, Pan, all bid him cheer, and
forget his love.]

9. This passage is imitated from Theocritus 1. 66, 69.

10. peribat, indic. as cum is purely relative: this is the common
usage when the cum-clause comes second.

indzjgno, used here and Ecl. VIII. 18: he seems to call the love
‘ unworthy' in both cases because it is wasted.

1 1. Pindus, great range oi mountains between Thessaly and Epirus.

12. Aganippe, fount of Helicon, called ‘Aonian⁷ (Aonie Greek form
of fem. adj. sor Aonia) because that was the name of the district where
Helicon lay 3 and it was all sacred to the Muses.

The Greek rhythm and hiatus go naturally with the Greek words.
Vergil has artificialised here the passage he imitates. In Theocritus the
singer asks the Nymphs where they were when Daphnis lay a dying.

‘Were ye on Pindus or the vale os Peneios? for not by the river
Anapus were ye, nor Aitna’s steep, nor Acis' holy spring': which is
intelligible as Daphnis is supposed to be dying in Sicily. But Vergil
uses the names without any such justification.

15. Alaenalus and Lycaeus, mountains of Arcadia.

us, neither do thou scorn them... ’. ἶ

19. upilio [ovi- pol·, the last element prob. connected with pol·, col-‚
in αἰ-πολ-ος, βου-κολ-ος, col-ere, and Pales, the rustic goddess] ‘the
shepherd’ an old, perhaps local, word.

20. ‘ Wet from the winter acorns' is interpreted by VVagn. (whom
most edd. follow) somewhat prosaically as meaning that he comes from
sleeping acorns sor fodder: but one fails to see how this would make
him wet‚ and it is a poorer sense oflzibema.

It is much more likely to mean he comes wct from the winter
oakwoods where he has been galhering acor-ns. Th<- acorn-season with
its late storms might be called winter.
