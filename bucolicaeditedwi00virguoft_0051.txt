sera tamen respexit, abridged neat phrase (like the Greek use with
ὅμως) for ‘though late, yet has looked upon me’.

use, dating the beginning of the new habit or state of things.

33. peculi, slaves were allowed to have private money, called
peculium. They were also allowed to marry, (though not a legal
recognised conubium: but Vergil is here thinking less of the life of
Roman‘slaves and more of the free loves of Sicilian shepherds.

35. pinguis, ‘rich’z perhaps what we call cream—cheese ; anyhow
good of its kind.

ingratae, playful indignation: the city did not pay him as much
as he wanted sor his cheeses.

[37—46. M. Ι wondered why Amaryllis was so sad. Tit. I had to
go. At Rome I saw the youth who gave me leave to stay on my land.]

37. Mel. playfully apostrophises the absent Amaryllis, who, in her
sorrow for having to part from Tityrus, calls on the gods and leaves
her apples ungathered.

39—40. He tells Tityrus, with playful exaggeration, that not Ama-
ryllis only, but the very springs and trees regretted his absence.

39. aberat, a long. The -at of imperf. was originally long, and
Vergil occasionally uses it so (tho' usually in a pause) from fondness for
archaic forms. Ennius has ‘ponebat ante salutem': Plautus has it long.

Augustus; and instead of buying his freedom he receives permission
not to leave his home.

46. submittite, ‘rear'‚ the regular word, cf. Georg. 111. 75, in spem
submittere gentis.

[47—59. M. Happy man, you will keep your sarm, and, poor tho’
the land be, you will be happy in the familiar lise, the sights and sounds
of the country.]

The sense is :—

48. ‘Tho’ the bare rock mars all your pasture, and the swamp
covers them with the muddy rush', obducat being more appropriate to
the last sentence, in which it occurs,——the figure zeugma.
