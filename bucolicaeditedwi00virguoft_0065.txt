ECLOGUE V.

[Two shepherds, Menalcas and Mopsus, meet, and after a little
mutual praise sor their powers in music and poetry‚ retire into a cave
and sing of Daphnis. Mopsus sings the lanient for his death, and
Menalcas sings of his deification. They then part after mutual
presents.

The poem is certainly early in work: it is a close Theocritean
imitation in subject, following the Daphnis lament in Theocr. ldyll. 1.
The original part is the second song of deification. And, as in B.C. 42>
was held the celebration of the sacred birthday of Julius Caesar (4 July)
who received divine honours, it is highly probable that the poem
belongs to that year, and had allegorical reference to Caesar. There
is no direct evidence of such allegory, but it quite suits Vergil’s
practice elsewhere: and the expressions ‘Daphnis inarvels at the
strange splendour of heaven’s threshold...looks down on clouds and
stars below him’ (56—7)...‘The rocks and trees reecho he is a god,
a god l’ (64)...And the mention os the ‘altars of Phoebus'in connection
with those of Daphnis (as the ludi Apollinares were celebrated on
6 July‚ Caesar's birthday on 4 July), all suggest the reference as
likel .] '
