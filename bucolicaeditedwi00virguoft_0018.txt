Julius Caesar is lamented under the name of Daphnis, the
unreality of youthful poetry may be said to be here at its
height. Nobody in the world could be less like a beautiful
young shepherd, lately dead, and lamented during their summer
siesta by his youthful comradeS, than Julius Caesar: and nothing
could be less like the genuine horrors of the year 42—the year
of Philippi—than the mock troubles of the Sicilian shepherd-
songs.

In the seventh Eclogue, which, as we have seen above, must
be classed with these early poems, we have again for the most
part a cento of passages from Theocritus, either imitated or
(sometimes) translated ; but we may note, besides the touch of
the true rustic poet in such lines as

muscosi fontes‘et somno mollior herba
et quae vos rara viridis tegit arbutus umbra
solstitium pecori defendite...,

also the admixture of genuine Lombard scenery in the descrip—
tion of his home :—

huc ipsi potum venient per prata iuvenci;
hic virides tenera praetexit arundine ripas
Mincius ......

All through these early Eclogues we have, in spite of
incongruities and crudities of taste, an ease and melody of
versification, and an occasional touch of real poetic description,
enough to show that Vergil was not a mere imitator.

The second group consists of those two that refer to the poet’s

farm and the difficulties (sufficiently explained above) connected
with the confiscation and restitution of the land.

In this group, though the form of the Greek pastoral is still
of course the main thing, and even in the details there is much
direct imitation, we note this change, that the poet is now using
the eclogue chiefly for allegorical purposes ; what he wishes to
convey is his doubts, his fears, and his gratitude‚ concerning the
fate of his farm ; and moreover he feels himself atssliberty to drop
the allegorical tone, and digress still further from the eclogue
proper, whenever it happens to be convenient, so as to mention
