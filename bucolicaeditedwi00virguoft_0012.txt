8 JNTRODUCTJON.

those which describe Sicilian shepherd lise ; the sports and
songs of the shepherds 3 their loves and jealousies and quarrels ;
the local superstitions ; local tales like that of Galatea and
Cyclops. These subjects‚ with lovely touches of Sicilian scenery,
and written in a sost and luxurious yet easy rhythm‚ make up the
new genus of poetry called Bucolic or Pastoral, or sometimes
known by its Theocritean name of the Idyll.

The poetry of Theocritus is half art and half nature. On the
one hand it is the product of a literary epoch and a luxui-ious
age ; it is a kind of reaction from city and court life in favour of
simplicity‚ open air, and rest. It is not the spontaneous singing
of shepherds from delight in the song3 it is rather the trained
and cultivated court poet who refreshes himself and finds a new
delight for his readers by painting in the most mellifluous verse
the sayings and doings-or rather the singings and laziness—of
the Sicilian shepherds. On the other hand, the shepherds that he
paints are real ; they are there with their sheep, their flutes‚ their
proverbs‚ their rude quarrels and ruder jests. There is plenty of
gaiety and life and natural beauty‚ but the country is no ideal
home of innocence; still less is there any learned allegory, or
any masquerading of cultivated persons in the guise of rustics.

But the form of Bucolic poetry once established, it lent itself
—like epic and didactic poetry—to imitation in latei· literary
ages, by poets who were attracted to the pastoral surrounding
as a convenient setting for their ideas ς but who were as far as
possible from wanting to describe any real pastoral life. It
became a convention of poetic art. It was understood, when
the poet began to talk of shepherds, that no real shepherds were
to be thought of; but the pastoral soreground was a pleasant and
familiar introduction to what the poet wanted to say. lt might
be a nature description 3 it might be a lament for a dead friend3
it might be a love story ; it might be some personal allusion under
the recognised disguise of shepherd names and pastoral incidents.
This sashion, with all its drawbacks‚ has produced in our
language some of the most beautiful poems we have, witness
Lycidas, Adonais, and Thyrsis; and of this fashion Vergil set
the example.
