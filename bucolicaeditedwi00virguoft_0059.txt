NOTES. 55

64. The apple was sacred to Venus, and the lovers’ fruit: lovers
gave each other apples, and the playful girl pelted her lover with them.
50 Theocr. v. 88.

66. meus tynis, ⁴ my love ⁹.

67. Some take Delia of Diana (born of Leto at Delos): but the
sense is poor and the expression forced : it is far better to suppose Men.
to mean ‘My favourite Amyntas comes often to me; not even Delia
(a shepherd maiden) is better known to my dogs'. A delicate way of
saying that everybody runs after him.

68. meae Veneri.- to cap meus ignis of his opponent.

69. congessere, ‘have built': the dove being another lovers’ gift.

palumbes .· see note on 1. 58.

73. i.e. may the gods hear her (fickle) words of love, and bind her
tel> fulfil them. (It is evident by the parallel reply that this is a com-

aiut.)

[76—83. D. Iollas, send me your love Phyllis. M. Phyllis bade
me aloving farewell! D. Bitter is the wrath of Amaryllis. M. Sweet is
Am ntas.

376. damoetas makes a (playsul) appeal to an absent Iollas, in the
tone of a triumphant rival, to send him Phyllis to make merry with on
his birthday. Menalcas replies in the character of Iollas, satirically
assuming the part of the successful rival himself.

[This is the simplest explanation of an obscure and diversely inter-
preted passage]

77. faciam, (sut. ind.) ‘sacrifice' : a technical word, the full expres-
sion being sacra facere .· w'lnla is abl. instrum.

The sacrifice referred to is the Araban-alia, a rustic Spring festival
to Ceres, where the victiin was led round the field, (whence the name,
amb· arv·) amid songs and dances3 and milk, honey, and wine were
offered. See Georg. 1. 338.

79. longum must surely go with vale, ‘ a long farewell' : all
absence is long to the lover, and there is no difficulty in the phrase.

Notice the Greek metrical usage, val? inquit, shortening the long
vowel instead of eliding it before another.

80. triste, ‘a sorrow’, ‘a bane': common use of neut. adj.—varlum
et mutabile Femina, ὀρθὸν ἀλήθεια, μεταβολὴ πάντων γλυκύ, &c.

82. depulsis, ‘weaned’: the full phrase is a lacle depellere, Ecl.
VII. 15, or ab ubere depellere, Georg. 111. 187.

arbutus, the beautiful ‘strawberry tree’ with its dark leaves and
bright red berries, common in N. Italy.

[84—91. D. Muses, feed a cow for Polio. M. He too is a poet:
Muses, seed a bull for him. D. May he who loves Polio be as happy.
M. May he who loves Bavius love Maevius too.]

84. The dramatic illusion is interrupted by an abrupt transition
from the imitation of Greek or Sicilian shepherd-songs to a sudden
mention of Vergil's friend Polio and his rivals Bavius and Maevius.

Polio : C. Asinius Polio, friend and supportet ofJulius Caesar, consul
B.C. 40, won a triumph over the Illyrium, and established a free library
