NOTES. 75

55. ‘let the tamarisk sweat amber-ooze from its bark’. The
amber was supposed to be a hard gum stom alder or poplar (it is
really fossil turpentine). So Ov. Met. 11. 346 of the sisters of Phaethon
turned trees says, ‘They wept, aud the drops harden in the sun to
ani ber’. See note on 1v. 30.

electra, a cognate or internal acc. see Ecl. IV. 30.

57. i.e. let him become Orpheus on land, and Arion in the sea.
Arion the singer‚ friend of Periander of Corinth, sailing from Sicily
home with treasure, learned that the sailors meant to murder him for
his wealth. He asked leave to play a last tune. The dolphins
gathered round the boat to hear, and when he leapt into the sea,
one took him on its back and bore him safe to Taenarus.

59. This is one of Vergils blunders. Theocritus said (1.134)
πάντα. δ’ ἔναλλα γένοιτο, ‘let everything be upside down’. Vergil
evidently read it as though it were ἐνάλια. He means ‘let the whole
earth become mid sea’ . the climax of the upturning of things.

61. hoc munus, his life which he offers up for love of her.

[63—85. Alphesiboeus replies with the witch song: bring water
and herbs, charms will fetch Daphnis here. Charms can do anything,
draw the moon, change men, kill snakes. I wind three threads of three
colours and draw the image three times round. Amaryllis, plait the
three colours. As the clay hardens and wax melts in fire, so may he.]

64. naamanin possumus omnes, ‘ we cannot all do all things’: a
proverb naturally applied when a man asks help, as here. The Pierides
or Muses are asked to aid him in singing the incantation song of the
girl.

65. The maiden stands by the altar and speaks to Amaryllis her
comrade and helper.

66. adoles), ‘to burn': a curious word. Properly ‘to increase', so ‘to
honour’ gods by offering3‚ next ‘to offer’, and even as here ‘to burn':
e.g. ‘honour’ penates flammis Aen. 1. 704: ‘offer’ iussos honores 111.
547: ‘to light’, ad. altaria taedis VII. 71.

verbenas (our ‘vervain') seems to be used in a wider sense sor
‘ herbs’ for magio.

mascula, the best and finest frankincense was called ‘ male ’.

67. sacris, subst„ ‘ rites’.

68. carmina, in special sense of ‘incantations‘‚ magic songS‚
charms.

70. Ovid of the witch Mycale says (Met. XII. 263) ‘she had often
drawn down the horned moon with song’.

71. Circe in the Odyssey charmed wild beasts tame, and changed
the comrades of Uly sses to swine.

Note form Ulixi from Ulixes. So Α Ιιίίίι, G. 111. 91

72 So the witch Medea 1n Ovid (silet. VII. 203) says. ‘I break the
viper’ 5 jaws with charin and chantss

74. terna, prob. simply‘ three’ ‚ as line 78 and osten ln poetry y.

77. Probably spurious: as without it the songs are of equal length.

81. The clay and the wax are perhaps two images, as such charms
were common in magic. But in the Theocr. which V. imitates, the
witch throws in a lump of wax (Π. 28).
