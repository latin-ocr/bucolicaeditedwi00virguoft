NOTES. 81

ECLOGUE X.

The date and the literary character of this poem have been sufficiently
discussed above, Introduction, pages 11, 12, 18.

The poem is a pastoral exaggeration or idealisation, having for its
subject a love-romance of Cornelius Gallus, the poet and soldier, friend
of Vergil, of whom an account is given above, note on V1. 64. The girl
whom he loved was according to Servius a certain slave Cytheris, who
had been set free by her master Volumnius: and Gallus had written
elegies to her under the name of Lycoris.

Vergil supposes Gallus, under the usual disguise of the conventional
pastoral, as a shepherd friend3 he is dying ,on the mountains of Arcadia
for love of Lycoris. The poet, also a shepherd, while his goats browse,
breaks out into song over his sriend's fate. He calls on the Nymphs:
he describes the mountains and trees and animals, and Menalcas the
poet, coming to sympathise: even Apollo, Silvanus and Pan come too.
Gallus replies to them, that he would fain have remained a shepherd
with them: but a mad desire has made him a soldier, and the girl he
loved hzss left him sor another, and gone to the Alps. He will sing
pastorals: he will carve his love’s name on the tree: he will hunt with
the Nymphs—all in vain, it will not cure his love! The poet ends with
an address to the Muses, and takes his farewell, sor the evening is
corne.

On the unreality of all this we have spoken above, Introd. p. 18.

The soldier Gallus peeps through the thin shepherd disguise even in
the poem itself. But the faults of this kind os poetry are partlydue to
the conventional limits within which Vergil was working, and partly to
his youth. In spite of all, the poem is full of a strange and fascinating
beauty: and through the artificiality we feel a poetic genius, a deep
love of nature, and the strong and imaginative affection which Vergil felt
sor his friend.

It is needless to remark that, from such a fancy picture as this, it is
impossible to infer any historica} facts about Gallus and his unhappy
love. It is indeed possible that Gallus was engaged at this time on
service in Italy, and that Cytheris had gone to Gaul, as 44—7 seems to
indicate. But it is to the last degree unlikely that the active and gifted
soldier would be seriously perturbed by the caprices of a Greek dancing
girl: and the fact (if we assume it on Servius' authority to be a fact),
that he had written four books of elegies on her, does not make it less
unlikely. That the poet should use an exaggerated and possibly even
largely invented romanoe, connected with the name of his most intimate
friend, as the vehicle sor some beautiful and sincerely felt love-poetry
and nature-descriptions, will not surprise anyone familiar with the history
of literature.
