Γ fitltus: u long in arsis, i.e. by stress of the foot,—not uncommon
icense.

56. Dictaeae, because Dicte is a mountain in Crete, and the whole
is a Cretan story.

60. Gortynia, ‘ Cretan ⁷, from Gortyna a town in Crete. She bids
the nymphs guard the openings in the woods, lest the bull meet her:
perhaps, enticed by grass or the Cretan cows, he may be near. All this
passage shews an increasing command of the varieties of hexameter
rhythm.

61. puellam: Atalanta, an Aetolian maid, very swift of foot, made
her suitors raee with her, under pledge that if defeated they should die ;
if victorious, the winner should wed her. She was at last beaten by
Hippomenes, who enticed her to swerve in the raee by throwing a
golden apple, from the fabled garden of the Hesperides beyond the
Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar).

62. Phaethontiadas: the daughters of the sun, sisters of Phaethon,
who yoked the horses of the sun for their brother to drive. He drove
the sun's car near to the earth, and Zeus killed him by a flash of
lightning : the sisters who bewailed him were changed into alders (or, as
V. elsewhere says, poplars) Aen. Χ. 190. Ovid's version says nothing of
their yoking the car, but merely that they bewailed the dead body of
their brother.

Many edd. say Phaethontiadas is used by extension [of the ordinary
usage of patronymics to mean sisters of P. ε but as the sun himself is also
called Phaethon, the ordinary meaning ‘daughters' will do.

For circumdat, eregit, see note on solatur, 46.

[64—end. Then he sings of Gallus, led by a Muse as he wandered in
Boeotia to their sacred mountains, where the poets arose before him, and
Linus gave him the reed-flute of Hesiod, and bade him sing of Apollo's
Grove at Grynium. Then he sings of Scylla daughter of Nisus, and
how she assailed Ulysses' ships: of the feast and transformation of
Tereus and Philomela—all that Phoebus once sang to Eurotas, when
the valleys heard and told the stars—till evening came]

64. Permessus, river of Boeotia rising in the Muses’ sacred mountain
Helicon, and flowing into lake Copais.

Gallus, Vergil’s friend C. Cornelius Gallus, who came from Gaul
and settled at Rome, at the age of πο, about 46 B.C. He was a poet
and orator and soldier3 and after Julius Caesar's death espoused the cause
of Octavianus. In 4² he was appointed commissioner (with Polio and
Varus) to divide the lands near Cremona and Mantua among the
soldiers—-and helped Vergil to recover his sarm. In 31 he commanded
a detachment at Actium, and when Octavianus returned to Italy,
Gallus was sent to pursue Antony. He completely succeeded in break-
ing the Egyptian power, and was made first prefect of Egypt. Here aster
some years he became arrogant and gave offence to Augustus, who
deposed him; and he killed himself B.C. 26.

He was a friend of all the eminent men of the time, Vergil, Polio,
