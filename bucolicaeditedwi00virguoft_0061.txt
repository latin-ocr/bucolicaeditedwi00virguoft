ECLOGUE IV.

The character of the fourth Eclogue is sufficiently expounded in the
Introduction (‘Execution of the poems’, p. 16), to which the reader
must be referred. It is a vision of the new golden age under Augustus:
and it is connected with the birth just about this time of a child, whom
Vergil pictures as recalling by his adventures and exploits the heroes of
old (31—36)‚ and rising to power like his father, and at last to the
company of the gods (15—17). The buoyant tone of enthusiastic hope,
making allowance for poetic, and perhaps playsul‚ exaggeration, is not
difficult to understand. After the corruption and incapacity of the later
repubfic, and the ravages of the Pompeian war, the one hope seemed to
be the firm establishment of a central rule under the Caesars. This
hope had been rudely broken by Julius Caesar’s murder in 44, but
revived again, when Octavianus in the great battle of Philippi defeated
(42) the party of Brutus. The interval had however been a good deal
disturbed by rivalry between the party of Caesar and the malcontents
who made common cause with the followers of Antony. There had
been in 4² a rising of Antony's wife and brother (Fulvia and Lucius) in
Latium, which was finally crushed at Perugia in 41. There was a
remnant of the Senatorian malcontents under S. Pompeius in Sicily,
still lingering after the defeat of their friends at Philippi. Antony returned
in late autumn (41) to gather up these fragments, and fight it out with
Octavianus. But the armies refused: they had had enough, and they
forced their leaders to make overtures of peace, which was concluded at
Brundusium (40 B.C.). This peace was confirmed by the marriage of
Antony with Caesar’s sister Octavia, Octavianus himself being married
about the same time to Scribonia. The civil wars seemed over; the
general eessation from hostilities restored the hopes of everybody: and
the universal enthusiasm inspires the sanguine exultation of the 4th
Eclocrue.

Tehe real difficulty however remains : who is tlze child?

Three solutions have been suggested :

(1) the child of Scribonia and Octavianus :
(α) the child of Antony and Octavia:
3) the child of Polio.

(1) The child of Scribonia and Octavianus is in the last degree

unfikely, as it was a girl, namely the afterwards infamousJulia. Vergil
