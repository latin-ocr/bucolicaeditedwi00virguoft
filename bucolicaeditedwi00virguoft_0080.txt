84. in Daphnide, ‘on Daphnis’ : whether literally on the image, or
figuratively.

[85—end. May Daphnis be eonsumed by love like that of the heifer
for the steer. These relies he left me3 Ι bury them; they will bring

96-—7. Colchis, on the extreme east of the country known as
Pontus (lying along S. and E. side of the Euxine), was the home os
the princess Medea, famous for her powers in magic- The potent herbs

98. To turn into a wolf, to summon ghosts, and to bewitch crops
from one field to another, were included, according to old beliefs, in

for inipiety.) There was a law of the XII Tables against bewitching
crops away (excantare frugsss).

102. rivo fluenti, dat. ‘into the strealn': common poetic use of the
recipient dat. where in prose we should have ad or z'n with accus. So

perhaps due to the personifying instinct of poetry.

103. The throwing ashes over your head without looking back is
like many other charnis. The idea is that the ashes are to be carried off,
and the supernatural powers are to work unwatched. So in offerings to
the Furies, Sophocles, O. C. 490, the rule is ‘depart and look not behind'.
When Deucalion made anew the human race he threw stones over his
head and looked not behind. So Odysseus cast the magic scarf which
had saved him from the sea ‘behind him into the sea, and looked not
back' (Oafi‘ss. V. 549).

with inf. in poetry.
