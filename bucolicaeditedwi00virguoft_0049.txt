NOTES.

ECLOGUE Ι.

Tityrus, a slave overseer of a farm, has been to Rome to buy his
sreedom, seen Augustus, and received permission to reinain on his land.
He meets Meliboeus a Shepherd who has been turned out. The Eclogue
consists of the laments os Meliboeus and the gratitude of Tityrus,

The poem is a rather crude allegory. In 42 B.c. when Octavianus
returned aster the victory of Philippi he distributed lands to the soldiers.
He took the lands of the neighbourhood of Cremona and Mantua,
dispossessing the owners. One of these was Vergil, who lived at Andes
near Mantua. Vergil by help of Asinius Polio (then governor of Gallia
Transpadana), and others, went to Rome and recovered his farm from
Octavianus. This poem he wrote in gratitude. For fuller explanation
of the circumstances see Dates of the Eclogues‚ above, p. 9.

driven into exile.]

forest pasture where the shepherds seed their flocks.

tenui avena, ‘the slender oat ⁷, i.e. the rustic pipe.

(So the English pastoral poets speak of ‘oaten stop '‚ ⁴ oaten pipe ⁵.)

4. Notiee the pretty artifice, whereby he begins and ends with
Tityrus.

lentus, ‘ at ease '.

5. ⁴ teach the woodland to reecho the fair Amaryllis ’‚ i. e. the
shepherd sings or calls upon his love, and the woods reecho the
name.

The acc. Amaryllida is a kind of z‘nlernal or extendea' cognate like
agere Antiopen, saltare Cyclopa, vox hominem sonat.

g 6. deus is Octavianus. To speak of Octavianus as a god to whom
lambs will be sacrificed is at this date probably only a half playsul
exaggeration ; but afterwards of course the emperor Augustus was
regularly deified, and even in the Georgies (1. 34) Vergil speaks of the
signs of the Zodiac crowding up to make room for Augustus.

The sacrifice is further explained (43) as being 12 days every year,
evidently referring to the offerings on the first of every month to the
household gods or Lares.
