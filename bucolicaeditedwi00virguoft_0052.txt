48 VERGJL. ECL. J.

translating graves ‘ weakly' ‘slow’: but the other is the proper meaning
of gravis, and fetus too. So A. 11. 237, machina feta armis, os the
wooden horse with soldiers inside.]

h 52—59. This pretty passage shews well Vergil's inborn love of
t e countr .

53. frigus opacum, ‘the cool shade ’; sacros, as every spring or rill
had its god, or nymph.

54. quae semper, ‘as ever', ‘as of old’, ab limite, ‘on the bonler’,
like a latere, a tergo, a dextra.

55. ‘its willow blossom rifled by the Hyblaean bees’.

Hyblaeis, the bees of Hybla in Sicily were famous, and this is what
is called the ‘literary’ use of epithets: wine is called ‘Massic' or
‘Falernian’, marble is ‘Parian’, the arrow is ‘Cydonian', the bow is
‘Parthian ’, διε. not so much to specify the kind, as to remind the reader
of the Greek poets who speak of them.

florem depasta, might be acc. of respect ; but considering Vergil’s
usage, it is much more probably the Greek use of acc. of the object after
the perf. passive, really an elastic extension of the active construction
to the passive voice.

Thus the Greeks say:

A clive Passim
ἐπιτρέπω σοὶ τὴν ἀρχήν ἐπιτέτραψαι τὴν ἀρχήν
ἐγγράφω τῇ δέλτῳ ξυνθήματα δέλτος ἐγγεγραμμένη ξυν θήμα ⁷ α

This usage the Roman poets imitated, as well as the acc. aster
the middle, which they very likely did not distinguish from the other.
Other instances of the acc. after passive are susus barbam A. x. 838:
inscripti nomina regum Ecl. 111. 106: per pedes traiectus lara A. 11.
272: caesariem effusae G. IV. 337: caeruleos implexae crinibus angues
G. 1v. 482.

56. Notice the soothing whispering sound, produced by the sibi-
lants and liquids, to imitate or suggest the thing described. So Tenny-
son's famous lines in the Princess:

‘The moan of doves in immemorial elms
and murmur of innumerable bees’.

57. frondator, the ‘pruner’ οι· ‘dresser’ had much to do, we are
told in Georg. 11. 397—419: he clipped the bushes and willows, ‘leal'ed’
the elms to let the sun in on the grapes, pruned the vines, and plucked
leaves for sodder.

58—59. palumbes. Mr Fowler, in his careful chapter on the Birds
of Vergil, identifies the palumbes with two species, the wood-pigeon

. and the stock-dove: ‘Perhaps the stoekqdove is the more likely of the

‘two to have been the bird generally meant: but it is quite possible
‘that the Romans eonfounded the two species’ (A year with the birds,
. 11 .

p 55.) turtur is the turtle-dove: ‘it is still found in small numbers

‘passing the summer and breeding in Italy, and is most frequent in

‘the subalpine region of which Vergil is here writing' (ib. p. 1 13). .
