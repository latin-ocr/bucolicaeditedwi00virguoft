4. Outlz'ne os Vergil's life.

P. Vergilius Maro was born 15 Oct., B.C. 70, near Mantua,
a town on the Mincio in North Italy, then called Cisalpine
Gaul. He had not good health, and after being educated at
Cremona and Mediolanum (lllz'lan), and studying Greek and
philosophy elsewhere, he came back to live (probably) on his
father's farm, until about B.C. 42. In that year Octavianus,
afterwards the Emperor Augustus, had defeated at Philippi
Brutus and Cassius, the murderers of Julius Caesar3 and gave
lands to his victorious soldiers in various parts of Italy,
amongst other assignments being Vergil's farm. The poet's
first acquaintance with Augustus was due to this event; for he
applied to him at Rome for the restitution of his property, and
was successful. He became the friend of the rich art-patron
Maecenas, the poet Horace, and the brilliant circle of literary
men who were collected at the court of Augustus. The works
of Vergil are not voluminous. The Eclogues are Idylls in irni-
tation of the Greek poet Theocritus, and were written sometime
before he was 33. The Georgics, an agricultural poem in four
books, of which the form was more or less suggested by
Hesiod, he wrote in the next few years, finishing them sometime
about his 40th year. The Aeneia, his great work, he appears
to have begun about B.C. 27, when he was 43 years of age, at
the wish of Augustus. A few years later, finding his health
failing, he tried travelling; and in the spring of 19 he was at
Athens. The summer he spent with Augustus abroad, but died
afew days after reaching Brundusium on his return. The day
of his death was Sept. 22, and he was not quite 51. He was
buried at Naples, where his tomb is still shewn, though the
authenticity of it is at least doubtful.

His character seems to have been most simple, pure, and
loveable ; and his poetic farne was well established even before

his death.
