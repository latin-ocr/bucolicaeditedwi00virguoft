NOTES. 69

Varus, Ovid. Vergil here treats him to a rather extravagant compliment,
making him honoured by the Muses on Helicon.

65. Aonia was the name given to the district of Boeotia where
Helicon was. sororum are the Muses, who dwelt there.

67. Linus, a beautiful youth, son of Apollo and a Muse, who died
young and was lamented by dirges, as a singer himself. There was a
specIiahl Blontian ugorslii‘p of hprli, 3ηέ he {jadssgrptto on ἓῖεᾏὶίἕοῐις

e aments or lnuS, 1 ‘e t ose or a ms an oms, are
perhaps symbolical laments for the withering of Epring beauty under the
summer heats. See Introduction.

70. Ascraeo seni : Hesiod, born at Ascra in Boeotia near Helicon.
The reference is to Τήιος. ‘22 sqq. where the poet says that the Muses
taught him song as he was keeping sheep on Helicon, and gave him a
Rpugh of bay, and bade him sing of gods and specially of them, the

uses.

71. This is told usually of Orpheus.

72. his, ‘on these’ reeds.

Servius tells us that the Greek poet Euphorion (220 Rc.) had sung
the story of Apollo's grove and sanctuary at Grynium (old place on coast
of Mysia in Asia Minor) which had been founded there by Grynus.
These two seers Mopsus and Calchas contended for the prize of divina-
tion: and Calchas being defeated died. This the poet Gallus had trans-
lated.

73. i.e. that the fame of it may be increased.

l 74.f SScjlillarg is govDe'rned by nt narraverit. ‘Why should Ι tell
iowo e a esantr.

Stylla,ydau[ghter gf] Nisus king of Megara, when her father was
besieged by the Cretans, fell in love with Minos their king, plucked out
the golden hair of life from her father’s head, and so the city fell to
Minos. The latter then drowned the impious daughter: or she drowned
herself, according to another version. See G. 1. 404. Vergil, like other
poets, bleuds this story with that of Scylla daughter of Phorkys, who
became a sea monster, girt with barking dogs, and devoured many of
thfi: sailp1rs of Odysseus when they passed through the straits (Messina)
w ere s e was.

75. ‘ Her fair loins girt with barking monsters’ z for construction of
acc. see Ι. 54.

76. Dulichias, from Dulichium, an island near Ithaca, subject to
Ul sses.

γ78. Ovid’s story is as follows: Tereus wedded to Procne loved also
her sister Philomela, did her violence, and cut out her tongue to ensure
silence. Philomela embroidered the story of her wrongs and sent the
tapestry to Procne. Between them they revenged the injury by slaying
Tereus' son Itys and serving him up at a feast. When he discovered it,
he tried to slay thern, but all three were changed into birds, Philomela
a nightiugale, Procne a swallow, Tereus a hoopoe.

83. Eurotas, the river of Sparta, where lived Hyacinthus, the
beautiful youth beloved by Apollo.

85. referri: a variety, instead of putting it active as would be
natural.
