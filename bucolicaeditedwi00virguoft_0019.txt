JNJRODUCTJON. 15

by name the persons and the places he is thinking of. Thus, for
example, in the first Eclogue, the supposed Sicilian shepherds
speak of a visit to Rome3 while in the ninth they talk freely of
Varus, Mantua, Cremona, the Roman poets Varius, Cinna, and
Anser, and the phenomenon of Caesar's star.

But though there are from a literary point of view these
incongruities, there are at the same time more touches of reality
than before. The rustic descriptions are less Sicilian and more
truly Lombard ; eg. i. 14, 48, and specially the exact picture of
the poet's horne1 given in the beautiful lines of Ecl. 9,

certe equidem audieram, qua se subducere colles
incipiunt, mollique iugum demittere clivo,
usque ad aquarn et veteres iam fracta cacumina fagos...

We may note also the lines of almost pathetic clinging and
affection for the home of his infancy,—a pathos so character-
istic of the poet,—which we find in i. 68—78; ix. 2, 19.

The sixth Eclogue, which, as we have seen above, probably
belongs to the same period, is the first which deserts Theocritu53
it is an experiment in a new field. Ι do not mean that there is
no echo of the Greek pastora13 for in the half-playful description
of the finding of Silenus drunk there are reminiscences. But
the main part of the poem is the song of Silenus itself3 and
this is very noticeable as the first imitation of Lucretius. Vergil
must have been familiar with the great poem of Lucretius for
the last fifteen years or more, i.e. ever since it was published in
B.C. 54. But it is quite natural that he should have preferred
the much more easy task of imitating Theocritus as his first
attempt in poetry. In the sixth Eclogue we have not merely a
striking passage of a Lucretian character in his description of
the creation, lines 30—-40, but also in the rest of the song, which
is less distinctively Lucretian, or not Lucretian at all, there is a
marked increase in the variety, the stateliness„ and the force of
the versification.

There remain the 4th, 8th‚ and 1oth, which had better be
considered separately.
