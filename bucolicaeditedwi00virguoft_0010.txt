6 PREFATORY NOTE.

With the text there has not been much to do. Such
differences as there are in the different copies, and they are
not very many (apart from obvious and easily corrected error-s),
are mostly unimportant : where the reading is really difficult to
decide 1 have given reasons for the one preferred.

The following books have been used in the preparation of
this little edition; to whose help my acknowledgments are
due 3-

Conington's Vergil, last ed.
Ribbeck's Vergil, 1859.
Heyne's Vergil, 1821.
Forbiger's Vergil, 18 52.
Wagner’s smaller edition, 1861.
Kennedy's School Vergil, 1876.

,‚ Text, Pitt Press, 1876.
Papillon's Vergil, Oxford, 1882.
Ladewig's Bucolics and Georgics, 1883.

For the matter of the Introduction and some of the notes
Ι owe much to Conington's Preface, to Prof. Sellar's most
interesting work on Vergil, and Simcox's Latin Literature.

Ι have used, and occasionally quoted, two translations of
‚these books : one by Lee and Lonsdale, a useful and careful prose
translation ; and one by Conington.

The following abbreviations are used in the notes:

C. Conington, L. Ladewig‚

W. Wagner, P. Papillon,
F. Forbiger, K. Kennedy,
Rib. Ribbeck, H. Heyne,

(LL) Lee and Lonsdale⁷s translation„
