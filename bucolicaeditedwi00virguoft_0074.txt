ECLOGUE VII.

This is one of the Theocritean imitations, and apparently has no
reference to contemporary events,——to friends, to praise or blame of other
poets, nor to any personal or public matter‚—like many of the other
eclogues. In both style and matter therefore it belongs to the early period.

Meliboeus the shepherd relates a story of a singing match between .

Corydon and Thyrsis, in which the judge Daphnis gave the palm to
Corydon.

[1-—20- Daphnis sat under an ilex, Corydon and Thyrsis met there.
I chanced to come secking a goat: Daphnis called me. I lest my
charge to hear the match]

Ι. arguta. The verb arguo (from arg—‘bright’‚ argentum, argilla,
ἀργός, &c.) means ‘to make clear': the part. argutus means properly
‘clear’ ‘bright’z hence ‘loud’‚ ‘shrill’‚ ‘keen'‚ ‘quick’‚ a favourite
word os Vergil, used os sounds, movement, and even smells.

Here it means ‘rustling't the word suggesting not so much the
loudness as the high-pilclzcd sound, so to speak: the shiverz'ng lzissz'n-gr
sound of stiff leaves with the wind blowing through them.

4. Arcades (Greek form), from Arcadia, in Peloponnese, the
typical shepherd country, the home of the Pan-worship.

The scene of this Eclogue is fancy-land t we have Sicilian shepherd
lise, and Sicilian summer and treeS, Arcadian singers, and the Lombard
river Mincio, all together.

5. This line is best taken without stop, ‘ready to sing and answer
in rivalry (pares).' Otherwise the antithesis is between pares and parali,
which is too much osa stiff conceit, ‘ equal in song, and ready to reply’.

7. vir, ‘the lord’: a playful touch. In deerraverat deer- is one
syllable3 a similar contraction in deest, deinde, deerunt.

11. potum, supine, ‘to drink’: really of course old acc. of verbal
substantive.

12. The river, the grassy bank, the soft reeds, the oak tree, the
swarming bees—are a refreshing touch of real description of home scenery
amid the literary reminiscences. Vergil‘s father is traditionally reported
to have kept bees: and as the fourth Geozgzk, and similes in the Aeneis!
shew, Vergil always took great interest in them.

14. quid facerem? past delib„ ‘ what was Ι to do ?’

Alcz'ppe and Phyllis, shepherd girls : ‘ I had no girl to help me’ like
other shepherds.

16. Corydon cum Thyrside is a natural sort os apposition, common
to all languages.

18—19. ‘With song and reply they began the strife: song and
reply 'twas the Muses’ pleasure to recall ’.
