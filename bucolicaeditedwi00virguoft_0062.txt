58 VERGJL. ECL. JV.

would hardly have written this poem before the birth of the infant, when
there would be an even chance of his glowing prophecy being thus made
ridiculous. Moreover, ‘incipe‚ parve puer, risu cognoscere mati-'em
(line 60), and the line which follows likewise‚ is plain· proof that the
child was boin, and was a boy. And even supposing we assume
the opposite, Vergil could not have allowed this prophecy, proved
to be e1r‚oneous to appear in all its absurdity three years later, when the
Eclogues were published.

(2) The child of Antony and Octavia is equally out of the question.
For first, Octavia' s first child after her betrothal to Antony was the child
of Marcellus: secondly, it was likewise a girl: and thirdly, Antony
was Caesar's dangerous rival, and, tho’ reconciled, would hardly receive
such a complinient from the court favourite Vergil.

(3) We conclude therefore it must be the child of Polio, born in this
year, and afterwards known as Asinius Gallus. The objections to this
ar:e the phrase le consule, line ιι, which seems strange as addressed to
the father: and the strong expressions about the boy as of <livine origin
(49 ), destined to divine honours (15), and to the goveyrnment of the world
(ι7). The answer is. first, that the consulship was still a splendid posi-
tion, and had not sunl< to be the nominal honour it was later: and that
at the beginning of the new era the birth of Polio’s son should fall in the
year when Polio was consul was a happy coincidence worthy of mention.
Secondly the whole new generation is to share' in the great renovation3
and Polio’ s son is only the firstborn and the greatest. T he‘ government
of the world' need not mean more than the consulship, which still
controlled the whole empire: the boy is to be consul like his father.
Lastly‚ as is more fully set forth in the introduction (p. 16), something
must be allowed to poetry, and to sriendsbip, and even to playsulness.

[1—47. Let me sing a higher strain, worthy of a Consul, Polio.
A new age begins: the Age of Gold once more, and the birth of a boy
ushers it in. He will be raised to divine company, and rule the world.
The earth will offer its fruits spontaneously: evil things shall perish:
there will be left a few traces of ill, which will lead to brave deeds and
adventure—the glories of lason and Troy repeated, when he is a man.
Commerce will cease: vi ealth and beauty will come unsought: such is the
will of Fate ]

critus, Moschus, and the Grteel pastoral poets generally.

3. consule.- Polio, see Introduction to the Eclogue.

The geneial sense is ‘let rny rustic song be worthy of the consul’.
His song is still rustic in the sense that he speak s of flowers, goats, tices,
fields, ploughing &c.

4. Cumaei. The so-called Siby lline books were prophecies sup-
posed to have been uttered by an inspired halfdivine woman called a
Sibyl, who lived in a cave in the promontory of Cunie or C>me in
Campania (Aen ΙΙΙ. 441).

Ἱ he belief 1n such inspired women (of whom several are mentioned)
was originally Greek. 'lhere are two different prophecies here put
tonether.
