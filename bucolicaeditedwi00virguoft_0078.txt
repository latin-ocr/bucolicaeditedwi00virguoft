30—31. The ‘torches’ were the regular accompaniment of the

ig. is rising over Oeta (mountain in Thessaly), and so the night is

children: now let all go awry, fierce become timid, barren trees
fruitsul‚ the §nean vie with the great—I will end my sorrows by a leap
into the sea.

38—41. These four lovely lines, praised by Voltaire and Macaulay
(see lntrod. p. ιδ’), are suggested by Theocritus (XI. 25): ‘I loved you,
dear, when first you came with my mother to gather hyacinths from
the mountain, and I shewed you the way’: but it is noticeable that the

are simply ‘As I saw, so I loved’, vivid way of saying ‘to see was

the idea.

53—58. These wishes are closely imitated from Theocritus Ι. 132,
see Appendix. The idea of both is simple enough: if Ι am to
suffer such undeserved misery‚ let everything else be turned upside
down.

what might be expected: e.g. ultro compellat, astatur, increpat, of
being llze first lo speale .· ultro occurro, venio, peto, of coming unmlled:
