80 VERGIL. ECL. IX.

duceret expresses the gradual process of ‘drawing’ or contracting,
the colour, ‘and the grape take a deeper hue... '

50. poma, ‘fruit’ os all kinds, apples, chen-ies, nuts, figs, (lates, and
here pears.

51. fert, ‘carries away’.

52. cantando condere soles .· bold and striking expression for ⁴ sing
the long day thro’ till sunset'. It is literally ⁶ Ι buried the long days
with song'. The expression is Lucretiam, vivendo condere saecla (111.
1090), and Horace imitates it (Od. IV. v. ²9)-

condere: present, according to the idiom of memini when it is a per-
sonal memory of something done or witnessed by oneself.

53. oblita: passive: so we find passive use (side by side with regular
deponent use) of comitatus, expertus, confessus, effatus, imz'lalus,
mentitus, emensus, remensus, exorsus, partitus, veneratus, &c.

54. lupi &c. Is the wolf saw you before you saw the wolf, the
belief was that you were struck dumb. So at the drinking party in
Theocr. (xlv. 22) when the girl would not mention the name ofher toast
they say to her ‘won’t you speak? a wolf has seen you !'

55. satis saepe goes together, ‘osten enough ⁷.

[56—end. Lyc. Excuses increase my desire. All is still now—we are
half way, let us stop and sing: or if you sear rain, let us sing as we go.
llloeris. Wait till Menalcas comes back.]

56. causando, ‘by your excuses’.

in longum ducis, ‘you put off': it is a case of hope deferred.

57. aequoris Theocritean imitation (see Appendix)‚ ‘the sea': Vergil
mixes the Lombard and the Sicilian² the real and the ‘literary ', scenery
again and again. tibi ethic dat.

58. ‘the breath of the breezy murmur’: a pretty artificial inver-
sion sor the murmuring breeze, the samad being personified instead
of the orte.

5927( hinc adeo, ‘just here’ is half way: the Latin idiom is to say hence
for llere, looking at what remains to do.

adeo regularly emphasises demonstratives, pronouns, numbers, ἃς.
Tuque adeo, illum adeo, tres adeo, ἃς.

60. Bianor. Servius says that Vergil means Oenus the founder of
Mantua: but there is no need of this allegorical interpretation: Vergil
is simply imitating Theoc. who speaks of ‘ the tomb of Brasilas' as a land
mark.

61. For the need of ‘stripping' the leaves see θέοι-ς. ΙΙ. 400.

62. tamen, ‘still’‚ in spite of the delay.

65. fasce, ‘burden’, the kids he was carrying, lines 6 and 62.

66. puer et. Vergil uses a great many short syllables long (in the
stress of the foot), mostly in imitation of older poets‚ who wrote when the
syllables were long: e.g. he makes amor, pavor, clamor, genitor, labor,
soror ἃς. long. But also we have z'llrgitz'mate lengthenings like ebur,
puer, super.

67. ipse, Menalcas.
