the people too, looked forward to the coming age of peace and
progress, Vergil should have coupled the name of the son of
his friend and protector Polio, and so combined the national
hopes with the personal feelings and joyful anticipations of the
consul who was now expecting to be a father. The main
difficulty in taking these glowing lines as applied to the son of
a minister, and not of Augustus, is the extraordinary destiny
which the poet sketches for the infant. But if we regard them
as the half-playful though wholly affectionate prophecies of the
grateful youth, who owed to Polio his escape from poverty and
his introduction to the high society in which he hencesorth
moved, the difficulty is overcome. The annals of literature will
supply many examples of poems addressed to patrons in which
the expression is none the less sincere at bottom because it
admits certain licensed and traditional exaggerationS.

On the beauty of the poem as a work of art it is needless to
dwell. We feel when we read such lines as the description of
the golden age, or the outburst at the end,

0 mihi tum longae maneat pars ultima vitae, &c.

that we have risen out of the region of the prettinesses of the
earlier Eclogues into something of the largeness of manner and
sustained dignity of expression—always combined with a great
beauty and variety of melody—-which distinguishes Vergil⁷s
later work.

In the eighth⁸ Eclogue Vergil returns to his Theocritean
studies again. But here also, though in form he is very closely
imitating two of the Idylls of Theocritus, and trying the new
experiment, after his model, of songs accompanied with a
refrain, yet there is a perfectly free handling of his original, and
a great deal of variation in detail. Nothing can show the
rapidly developing genius of the poet so strikingly as a
comparison of the five most beautiful lines in the Eclogue with
the passage by which they are suggested in the Greek. The
lines are as follows:

saepibus in nostris parvam te roscida mala—
dux ego vester eram—vidi cum matre legentem.
