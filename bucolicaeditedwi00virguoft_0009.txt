PREFATORY NOTE.

THIS Edition, being prepared for the use of those Students
who are not far advanced in Latin, does not aim at doing more
than supplying in a small compass such help to the thorough
knowledge of this book as it is probable would be most useful
to them. It is not intended to supply the place of a dictionary :
for all students possess one, and derive much benerit from its
careful use, both in becoming acquainted with the lciswry (ff
meanings of words, and also in the exercise of that judgrnent
which is required to select the right meaning. On the other
hand historical and mythical allusions are explained in the
notes, as many students might find it difficult to make them out
otherwise. Great care also has been taken to notice all the
grammatical usages which might offer any difficulty, and to
classify them clearly, and to enable the learner, by means of an
Index, to compare similar usages and distinguish those that are
different. Attention has been given, too, to‘Vergil‘s licences
and peculiarities of expression, which help him so much in
producing rhetorical and poetical effects. Further, in several
of the harder passages and phrases, an attempt has been made
to help the student in translation : for while few ancient writers
are so difficult as Vergil to translate at all adequately‚ it is at
the same time of the utmost importance, both to the literary
appreciation of his poetry, and the advantage to be derived
from reading it, that great pains should be given to translation
and a high standard aimed at.
