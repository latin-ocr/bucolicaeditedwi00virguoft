NOTES. 73

by a similar exaggeration here the cattle, wild animals and streams are
spellbound by the shepherds‘ songs.

4. requierunt flumina cursus. The acc. cursus is best taken after
requierunt, used transitively here. So Servius takes it, quoting a line
stom Calvus (orator and poet, 12 years older than Vergil): sol meminit
reqm'escere cursus. So Ciris 283, requiescunt flumina cursus. Prop-
11. 22, geminas requieverat Arctos.

[6—13. Dedication. VVhether thou art passing Timavus or coast-
ing Illyricum—when shall I sing thy deeds? or praise thy poems?
With thee I began, and I will end. Take these songs, written at thy
biddin .

6. ἕέἳηιαυιιε was a little river above Trieste, at the head of the
Adriatic, issuing where there are caverns in the rocky coast, Aen.
Ι. 244.

superas, ‘art passing'.

The poet means wherever you are on your return (from the carn-
paign against the Parthini, a tribe of Illyricum near Dyrrhachium, whom
Polio defeated 13.c. 39), whether coasting near Tn‘este or further south.

10. The cothurnus or ‘buskin’ was the shoe worn in tragedies,
and is osten used as the emblem of tragedy. So Horace says of Polio
(Od. 11. i. 10) that when he has finished his history he will ‘return to
his high calling with the Attic buskin’. See Ecl. ΙΙΙ. 84.

11. desinet, ‘it shall end‘, i.e. my song. Polio will always be
his patron and his theme.

13. victrices laurus point to the date, when Polio had just won
his victory over the Parthini but not yet returned.

The z'vy (VII. 25) was the pastoral poet’s wreath.

[14—36. Damon began. ‘Rise Lucifer, while I a deserted lover
make my last song, and plaint to the gods. Maenalus ever hears the
shepherd-songs. Mopsus weds my love Nysa: then let horses and
griffins unite, hounds and does associate. Eve approaches: Mopsus,
play the bridegroom. You are a worthy mate, Nysa; you also despise
my shaggy locks, and impiously break your vows l]

15. cum refers simply relatively to noctis umbra: the ‘when'
required in English after ‘scarce had departed’ is omitted in the
Latin, as often is the ease.

16. olivae, ‘olive staff’: the olive trec is not teres at all, but
very rough.

18. coniugis, ‘my love’.

19. He has ‘not profited by the gods‘ witness’ because Nysa his
love has broken her oaths which he (or she) called the gods to witness.

21. The resrain is imitated from Theocr. 1. 66.

Α· Mantalios, ‘Arcadian’ (see V11. 3), from Maenalus a mountain of
rcadia.

²4· Pana: Greek acc.

26. Mopsus is the rival, of course another shepherd: such an
unequal match he compares to the most unnatural unions.

27. gyyplzes (Greek word) ‘griffins'‚ sabulous animal with four
legs, wings and claws, spoken os by Herodotus.

28. adpocula, ‘to drink '.
