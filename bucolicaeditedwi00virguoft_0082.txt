15. The raven on the lest confirmed a man in the course he was
thinking of adopting: a sinistra cornix facit ratum is Cicero' s phrase
(Diu Ι. 39), and the ravens on the lest consuadent in Plautus (Aszn. 11.
i 12). So Moeris must have determined to give way before he heard
his raven

16. viveret, ‘would be alive’ now· . the imperfect regularly used os
conditional clauses referring to present time, because being settled they
are treated as past. So in this case we osten use the past form, 'I
should not now have been alive’. See 19.

[17—29. Lyc. WVas Menalcas in such danger? alas! who would
there be to sing if we had lost him-like that song of his Ι overheard
you sing, about Tityrus and the goats? Μοεν. Ay, or the song he
made for Varus, about Mantua.]

17. i.e. ‘can any one be guilty of that?'

⁴19. caneret, i-e. ‘ who would there be to sing ?'

These lines refer to the fifth Eclogne, where (v. 20) the Nymphs
bewail Daphnis and (v. 40) the shepherds are bidden ‘scatter leaves on
the ground and curtain the springs with shade'. (In Ecl. 5 the songs
are both sung by Mopsus. but in this pastoral life they sing sreely
each other’ s songs: and Vergil himself' is the poet meant in either case. )

21 sublegi, to gather up secredy', and used by Plautus (Mzul IV. ii.
98) with sermon m sor‘ to overhear'· . so here.

²3· dum redeo: dum ‘until' sometimes used with pres. ind. ‘ego
hic dum exis, le opperiar, Pl. Alost. 683: delibem lzoc dum redeo Ter.
Ad. 11. i. 42 : ίιι laic nos dum eximus opperibere, Ter. Haut. 833.

A somewhat similar use of the present is found with antequam:

abitequagn de accusatione dico, de accusatorum spe pauca dicam (Cic.
et'ot. 2 .

24. inter agendum, ‘while driving’.
26. For Varus see Introduction to Ecl. 6. The poet is clearly

hoping sor help srom Varus to save the Mantuan property from the
confiscations.

28. vae...nimium vicina Cremonae because Cremona's lands were
first seized, then, as they proved insufficient, Mantua’s (or some of them)
'were added.

29. cycni. V. again speaks of the swans of the Mincio, ‘ snow-white
swans fed by the grassy stream’, Georg.11.199.

[30—55. Lyc. By all you ’hold desirable, sing. Ι too have songs,
but I arn not among the better poets—only a goose among swanS.
Moer. I try to recall the song—‘ Hither Galatea, all the flowers and
trees invite you’. Lyc. What of that other song? M'oer. ‘ Daphnis
why look up? see the star of Caesar !’ Alas how memory fails! when
a bpy Ι conl} sing all day! *my voice is going. But Menalcas will sing
it a l to ou.

30. ysic- ἃς. Α common iormula for entreaty was to couple thus a
good wish with the prayer: ‘So may your bees and cows prosper, szng
me the song'. Similarly Χ. 4, Szc tibi.. .D0ris amara. ,non intermisceat

navis...reddas incolumem, precor.
