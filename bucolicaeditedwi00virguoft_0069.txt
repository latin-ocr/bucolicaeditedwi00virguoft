ECLOGUE VI.

The sixth Eclogue is addressed to Varus. The poet seems to have
intended ‘or tried to write (cum canerem 3) an epic poem on ‘ kings and
battles‘‚ and the ‘praises of Varus, and sad wars’. What wars Varus had
conducted we know not : but anyhow Vergil gave up the task as beyond
him. In this eclogue, which he calls pastoral (agrestem, 8), though the
main interest is in Silenus’ song, he tells how the shepherds found Silenus
sleeping‚ and bound him sor a jest in his own chaplets, and painted his
sace with mulberry. Silenus promises them a song to release him : and
sings [here Vergil becomes Lucretian in style and matter] the tale of the
’ creation of the world: then the stories of Pyrrha, Prometheus, Hylas,
Pasiphae, Atalanta, the Phaethontiades.

Then he sings the divine honours paid by Phoebus and the Muses to
the poet Gallus, his friend: and the stories of Scylla, Philomela, and
other old tales.

[1—12. My first poems were rural : when I began to try epic,
Apollo forbad me. So I will return to rustic themes‚ and leave your
praises, Varus, to others to sing. Yet if these humbler strains find

Varus is clear to Phoebus-J

rustic muse, and was represented with a pedum or crook.

3. To ‘sing of kings and wars’ is to write Epic. Note tense of
canerem, ‘when I strove to sing.'

Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ear.

5. deductum, metaphor from spinning, ‘ drawn out’ i-e. ‘thin spun’.
(Milton evidently in the passage quoted had this word too in his mind.)
‘ A shepherd's sheep should be fat, his song slender’, is the sense.

6. super tibi erunt, ‘you will have plenty ³, super used adverbially.
For Varus see introduction to the Eclogue.

10. myricae, ‘the tamarisks' ε the shrub he selects to stand for
the woodland growth is characteristically taken from Theocritus, where

η. Shewing that this song was headed Varus.

[13—30. Two Satyrs found Silenus asleep and bound him with
flowers, a nymph painting his face. NVhen he awoke he promised sor his
freedom to sing what they wanted].

13. Chromis and Mnasyllos .· Greek names, probably os Satyrs.

14. Silenus, chief of the attendants of Bacchus, represented as a fat
